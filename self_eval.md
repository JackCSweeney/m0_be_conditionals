# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- Using a conditional is helpful when you are trying to compare different pieces of data and get specific responses based on how they interact with the conditions you set.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would have jumped to google a little bit sooner in the "spicy" coding challenge rather than experimenting with so many different methods that I was unsure of.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I am a big fan of logical thinking/logical thought processes, so thinking through the logic behind comparisons, if statements, and logical operators is very satisfying when you get the process to work how you intend it to!
